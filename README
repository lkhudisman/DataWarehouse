Table Comparison between MSSQL, Postgres, and MySQL databases

When you have data that gets synced from one database to the other it is helpful to verify if fields are being transferred correctly. 
That is where these Excel spreadsheets come in.

Setup:

Create ODBC connections to the databases on your system
Open Excel spreadsheet
Enable Micros execution
On "tables" tab enter data for comparison:
	Tables to compare
	Run "y/n" - this will determine which tables to compare
	Database names
	Keys to use in comparing data - leave blank the rest if you only have one
	"Select" query to get data you want to compare
Run Micros

ENJOY!
